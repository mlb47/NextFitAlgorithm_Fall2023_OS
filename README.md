# NextFitAlgorithm_Fall2023_OS

This program was created for a Fundamentals of Operating Systems course and practices simulating a modified Next Fit Allocation.

Given an input file of bases and displacements for memory blocks ["23F_COP4610_Project2_InputFileBaseDisp"], plus an input file of process sizes ["23F_COP4610_Project2_InputFileProc"], the program will allocate the processes to memory using a modified Next Fit algorithm. Structs are used to hold data relevant to the Slot and Process objects.

The program can be run with the makefile by using the command `make`
